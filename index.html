   <h2 id="about">About:</h2>
   <p>North America Competitive Krunker, better known as NACK, is a North American server that hosts games of Krunker. There are two levels to NACK, t1 and t2. In tier 2, you are most likely just starting. While in #queue , NACK operates as a first come first serve, CSGO faceit-like procedure. Some of the more useful commands in NACK are ++ to queue, -- to leave queue, !who to check queue, !promote to try and get more people, !rank to check your rank (only for those D- and up), !pick @[player] to choose a team member to be on your team (only works for captains) and !r, to ready up for the game. When there are 8/8 people, the NACK bot will send you a dm letting you know a game has started. To ensure that those in the game are still available to play, the NACK bot will ask you to ready up in queue (it will also ping you) By doing the !r command, you are telling the NACK bot that you are ready to play the game and you have the 15+ minutes it will take (max 30)  Although NACK is a very fun (for some) place, there are still rules in place. Most of the commonly broken ones are: asking for a sub, meaning that you cant play the game, even though you readied up. This offense will result in a Noadd. A noadd is like a temp ban from queueing. The time will vary from when you ask for a sub (during game, or before the picking stage) Another rule commonly broken is the TDM rule. This rule states that you must have 15% of your total team objective. Failing to do so will also result in a noadd. All noadds come with a warn, and if you accumulate a lot of warns, you may be banned from this server. Bribing any staff is an instant 7d noadd. If you need any assistance or you need to report and rule breaking, ping a helper. Do not excessively ping staff. Good luck, and have fun!</p>

   <h2 id="tips">Tips:</h2>
   <p>Many of those in NACK will think about doing a common method called "alting." Alting is when you make a brand new discord and krunker account to play under another name. If caught, you will receive a 7d ban from playing pickups and have your alt account banned. Please make sure to follow Discord ToS. Lots of info can be found in #info . In NACK, you should strive to be your best self. This includes vcs, in game, and in the text channels. Post results of the game in #results. Do not dm admins about NACK business, as they are busy a lot of the time.Channels such as #announcements and #info will provide any update to the rules. If you have krunker premium, do not abuse it in pickups with commands like /smite, as it is also a bannable offense. Commands only work in #commands. Another common method used by some to avoid losing elo is a method called dodging. Dodging is the process of appearing offline or unavailable to avoid playing a pickup. It will also result in an 18h noadd.</p>
